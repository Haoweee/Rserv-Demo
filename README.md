# Rserv

## Reservation System Demo

This is a simplified demo of a reservation system inspired by a contract project I worked on. It includes generic components and backend logic for handling table reservations, availability checking, and confirmations.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**

This demo has been stripped of all proprietary business logic, client-specific features, data, and branding. It is intended purely for educational and portfolio purposes.

## Features

- React + TypeScript frontend
- Node.js backend (JavaScript)
- Modular architecture for client and server
- Date/time selection and availability check
- RESTful API structure (e.g., `/api/reservations`)
- Basic validation and error handling

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MySQL
- Tooling: ESLint, Prettier, GitHub Actions CI

## How to Run

```bash
# From the project root
npm install
npm run install-all
npm run dev
```
